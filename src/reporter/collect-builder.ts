 * Assembles the final `Collect` payload at `onTestRunEnd`.

 * CI metadata and branch/commit detection are already fully resolved by

 * call `ci-detect`/`git-detect` itself, matching both sibling packages.
 *
 * `metadata` is not optional decoration: `qualflare-cli` identifies this
 * format by the presence of `framework` + `metadata` + `suites` together.
 * Omitting it makes the CLI fall back to filename matching, where a file
 * whose name contains a framework name is routed to that framework's own
 * parser and fails. For the same reason this payload must never grow a
 * top-level `config` key — that is the Playwright-JSON detector's signature.
 *
 * `framework` is what becomes `suites[].category` on the wire, and is the
 * value api-service validates against its test_type enum. It resolves to
 * `vitest`, which migration 0242 added.
